Mathematics does not have to be a barrier for your academic success.

Our current education system has a strong emphasis on mathematics. From standardized testing and AP courses to calculus prerequisites in college, having to excel in mathematics in order to pursue your academic dreams is essentially unavoidable. I believe that I have the skills and experience to aid students in that process.

I have been in education and education adjacent roles since 2016, when I started working as a Teaching Assistant and as a tutor for math courses on campus at Brown University. Since then, I have continued to hone my teaching skills by developing my own curricula to teach math enrichment at the Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, a nonprofit dedicated to providing access to advanced mathematics to low-income students of color.

Pulling from more than half a decade of experience, I aspire to guide students to become independent and flexible problem-solvers who do not need to depend on rote memorization.

Please reach out to me at ***tshima [at] gradcenter [dot] cuny [dot] edu*** to set up a time so that we can talk about your goals with tutoring!

Tutoring Policies:

The student must pay for a tutoring session by cash or by [Venmo](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=3490961111909966061&created=1670352653.043242&printed=1) as soon as possible after completion. Advance payments are also possible.

If the student must cancel a prepaid session for reasons of family emergencies or illness, they have the option of receiving a refund or applying the prepayment toward a future session.

Students who do not attend lessons without giving 12 hours advance notice to the tutor will be charged at full rate for the missed lesson. The tutor agrees to refund or apply any prepayment to a future session if the tutor cancels a session for any reason or at any time before the session begins.

Students who arrive late or who terminate their sessions early will not have their fees adjusted. By extending a lesson by mutual agreement and by the amount of lost time, any time lost due to the tutorâ€™s late arrival will be compensated for. If the student is not present after 15 minutes from the scheduled time of the session, the session will be considered canceled without sufficient notice and will therefore be subject to the cancellation and refund policy.
