Mathematics does not have to be a barrier for your academic success.

Our current education system has a strong emphasis on mathematics. From standardized testing and AP courses to calculus prerequisites in college, having to excel in mathematics in order to pursue your academic dreams is essentially unavoidable. I believe that I have the skills and experience to aid students in that process.

I have been in education and education adjacent roles since 2016, when I started working as a Teaching Assistant and as a tutor for math courses on campus at Brown University. Since then, I have continued to hone my teaching skills by developing my own curricula to teach math enrichment at the Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, a nonprofit dedicated to providing access to advanced mathematics to low-income students of color.

Pulling from more than half a decade of experience, I aspire to guide students to become independent and flexible problem-solvers who do not need to depend on rote memorization.
