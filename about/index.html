One way to define a translation surface is by gluing a piece of paper. Consider a polygon with an even number of sides so that each side can be paired with another side with equal length and slope. (Note that this condition is equivalent to having pairs of sides that differ by translations, which is where the term translation surfaces comes from!) Now, we can glue these pairs of sides together to obtain a translation surface. An example that might be illuminating is to take a square and glue opposite sides, since they differ by a translation. The resulting surface is a torus, otherwise known as the surface of a donut. Another way is to define a translation surface as a closed orientable surface with a holomorphic 1-form. Surprisingly, these two definitions are the same!</p><p>But why are these translation surfaces interesting? They are actually motivated by billiards on polygons. Pretend you are playing a game of billiards with a friend. However, this spot is a little strange in that instead of rectangles, the billiards tables are triangles. Even weirder, once you hit a ball, it never stops moving. Just to practice, you choose a random triangular billiard table and hit a single ball. Does it ever return to its original place? This has been unanswered for over 200 years, but for trangles with rational angles, it&rsquo;s been answered by &ldquo;unfolding&rdquo; the billiard table until you get a translation surface, and studying straight-line flows.</p><p>Translation surfaces are inspired by a dynamical systems question, yet are definable through both basic geometric constructions and complex analysis, allowing mathematicians to use various techniques from a many different areas of mathematics. This makes it particular appealing to study &ndash; a nice, gentle introduction that focuses on invariants of such surfaces can be found <a href=http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~masur/hs.pdf>here</a>, and a more advanced survery of topics <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0609392.pdf>here</a>.</p><hr><p>Artistically, I am interested in abstract expressionism and generative art. My journey into abstract art began after getting interested in Piet Mondrian&rsquo;s work, especially his transition from realism to abstract expressionism. In the latter part of the 1890&rsquo;s and early part of the 1900&rsquo;s, his work centers around depecting realistic landspaces. However, by 1910, you can start to see the transition into more abstract shapes, such as the Avond: The Red Tree (1908) and The Gray Tree (1911). By the 1920&rsquo;s he had completed his transition into compositions consisting of black lines with solid-colored boxes. Because of this transition, it feels like there is a reference for his abstraction. For example, his painting View from the Dunes with Beaches and Piers feels like his more modern compositions, even though it is landscape painting.</p><p>My appreciation of the beauty that abstract expressionism could convey was solidified when I encountered Agnes Martin&rsquo;s work at a retrospective at the Guggenheim. Her paintings use very differences of the color white, such as slight blue, yellow, or red tints that are imperceptible at first glance. This asks the viewer to take their time looking at the painting until it&rsquo;s patterns are revealed. Unfortunately, in pictures, this imperceptible difference is exaggerated in way that breaks the effect. Yet, these paintings left a lasting impression of what painting can do and convey.</p><p>Nature has this captivating, ephemeral beauty that&rsquo;s hard to convey and capture with realism. I have this strong feeling that it is possible to represent natural scenes with abstract shapes to capture this beauty.</p><div class=footer></div></div></body></html>
