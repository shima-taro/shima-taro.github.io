      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>

      <description>Impostor syndrome and the genius myth permeate much of mathematics, and it has affected me more than I would have liked in my years studying math. Recently, however, I feel much better about the relationship between myself and mathematics. It took a radical shift in the way I think about how I interact with math, and by writing these thoughts down, I hope to remind myself of these thoughts if in the future I find myself doubting again whether I belong in math.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hello, friend?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s lame. Maybe I should give you a name&amp;hellip; But that&amp;rsquo;s a slippery slope. You&amp;rsquo;re only in my head. We have to remember that&amp;hellip; Shit. It&amp;rsquo;s actually happened. I&amp;rsquo;m talking to an imaginary person.
